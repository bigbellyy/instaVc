            <p>InstaVC is a minimalistic web application that enables two people to connect instantly via a voice call.
                To initiate a call, a user must press "Host Call" and will be provided with a unique call code. This
                call code can be shared with anyone, and entering the call code into the website will instantly connect
                the user to the call.</p>
